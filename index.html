									Hello World! My name is John Blackwell and I am a new coder in the Richmond, VA area. I am learning to code through the <a class="plinks" href="https://codingbootcamp.richmond.edu/lp2/?s=G-Unbranded&dki=Coding&utm_cost=0&mkwid=aqD05vS3_dc&pkw=%2Bcoding%20%2Buniversity&pcrid=206937172244&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%5BS%5D+General+Coding+-+Broad&utm_term=%2Bcoding%20%2Buniversity&utm_content=206937172244&s=google&k=%2Bcoding%20%2Buniversity&gclid=CjwKCAjw7MDPBRAFEiwAppdF9ELfhhDamGzTxxPEP63QnJZpFVpMEw01IaH9hHLM8KkUZ8hAVgax5BoCC1YQAvD_BwE" title="U of R Web Development Program">University of Richmond's Full-Stack Web Development Program</a>. I gained an interest in coding after seeing my sister succeed with backend programming. I had been teaching myself through web tutorials and she and my family and my fianc&#233e encouraged me to take a more comprehansive program on web development to better gain a skill to apply as I work to change my career. I am applying myself fully to my learning, and hope to be employable soon. If you need to reach me please feel free to reach out to me through my <a href="./contact.html" class="plinks">Contact</a> page.

									I previously worked in food service and hospitality. Most recently I was the <em>Banquet Manager</em> at <a class="plinks" href="http://www.thecommonwealthclub.net/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&pageid=317171&ssid=208240&vnf=1" title="The Commonwealth Club">The Commonwealth Club</a>. I hired and managed about fifteen servers and bartenders. This would entail scheduling them, and occasionally temp staff, for events throughout the week including large scale (200-300 person) weddings. I never really expected to find myself there, but after getting a bartending certificate and then a job as a bartender at the Commonwealth Club, I started to enjoy working the larger events. After a couple of years where I bounced around helping out in different departments, I applied for a vacant manager's position and was promoted. I spent the last few years working there, but due to some life changes I wanted to move on from the demanding (and not so lucrative) schedule of a hospitality manager.

									One of the reasons I want to switch careers is because I would like to be able to spend more time with my fianc&#233e, Lindsay. We got engaged this year and are planning our marriage for April of 2018. We love traveling together. This summer we went to Virginia Beach, Washington D.C., Boston, New Hampshire, San Diego. She works as an elementary school teacher in Henrico county. She really enjoys working with kids, and being able to educate young minds. We have an apartment in downtown Richmond and a cat named Cellar. We also like to try out as many restaurants as we can, our most recent trip was to <a href="juleps.net" class="plinks">Julep's</a>, but our current favorite restaurant is <a href="lopossum.com" class="plinks">L'Oppossum</a>.

									I look forward to learning as much as I can about web development. I am learning the MERN stack, and already prove proficient with HTML and CSS. I also have some experience with Bootstrap 3, and am teaching myself Bootstrap 4.
